## Todo 

1. case 
  
    Change the case to a larger one, say Inwin 301 matx case. This will make a lot room for other staff like graphic card.

2. Graphic card

    I found amd card, like rx580 work out of the box, As my girl friend want to do photo work like PS and AE, maybe I need to add a graphic card.

3. wifi
  
    I Plan to use an Apple part to get wifi work out of the box. I do a lot of search and found that `bcm94360cs2` with m.2 adapter works fine. However the Inwin itx case is two small to fit the adapter. A larger case is needed. 

4. Magic trackpad

    I heard a lot that Apple's trackpad is a must for real Macos experience.
